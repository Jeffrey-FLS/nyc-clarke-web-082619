## What is the DOM (Document object model)
* We can use javascript objects to to represent HTML elements.
* These objects (aka "nodes") are related to each other in terms of parent and child relationship and make up a "tree".
* We can get from one node to another by `traversing the DOM`.

## Query Selectors
* We can quickly find nodes using `document.querySelector()`, `document.querySelectorAll()`.
  * Query selector will find a DOM node based on CSS Selectors.
  * There are other selectors such as `document.getElementById`, do your research.
